Multiplatform game created using Unity and C#. The main screen of the game displays the player, and the background. The obstacles and the background keep repeating and it seems like the player is on movement. The player can jump up and also move to the left and right. When the player goes off camera the game will display a Game Over and the player dies. If the player continues to pass through to obstacles the game will continue otherwise if the players collides with the obstacles the game will come to an end. The high score will be saved everytime the game ends.
