My name is Xhoana Koca (the 'Xh' is pronounced as a 'J' sound). I was born in 1998, in Korce, Albania. Don't let my birth year fool you; I can relate to millennials more. Growing up in Albania, I didn't have much access to technology, but I was still fascinated by how everything works. In 2009, my family got our first computer, I would spend hours on the computer, using the internet, and burning CDs for my friends. I became the go-to person in my family if something wasn't working, whether it was related to the computer or modem or even the tv.

When I was 12, my family and I moved to the United States. Learning a new language and getting used to the culture wasn't easy, but it has helped me and shaped me into who I am today. 
In 2016 I decided to pursue my college education in Computer Systems.  In my 4 years of attending New York City College of Technology I completed courses such as Object Oriented Programming in Java, Database, Multimedia and Mobile Device Programming, Advanced Web Client Technologies, Web Development. I learned how to build websites with HTML and CSS; I created my first game using Unity; I gained social and networking skills while working in teams for group Projects.

Currently, I am still learning and creating projects to improve my skills.
